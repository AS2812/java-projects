Data Structures Projects
This repository contains multiple projects demonstrating the implementation and application of various data structures. Each project focuses on different aspects of data manipulation, including sorting algorithms, sparse data representations, and real-world applications such as a restaurant management system and a hotel reservation system.

Projects Overview
1. Sorting Techniques with Simulation
Description:
This project implements and visualizes various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Counting Sort. The performance of these algorithms is compared using randomly generated, sorted, and inversely sorted arrays. The simulation provides a graphical representation of how these algorithms sort data.

Key Features:
Bubble Sort: Implements a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if necessary.
Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts by partitioning an array into sub-arrays, sorting them recursively.
Counting Sort: A non-comparison-based sorting technique that counts the occurrences of each element to determine their positions in the sorted output.
Visual Simulation: Displays the sorting process visually to help understand how each algorithm works in real-time.
Technologies Used:
Java
XChart for data visualization
Processing for graphical simulations
Example Usage:
java
Copy code
int[] array = generateRandomArray(100);
bubbleSort(array);
2. Sparse Table
Description:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a sparse table to store and manage data efficiently, particularly for scenarios with a large number of zero or null values. It focuses on optimizing memory usage while maintaining quick access and manipulation capabilities.

Key Features:
Sparse Matrix Representation: Efficiently stores non-zero values along with their coordinates to minimize space.
Data Manipulation: Provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing data in the sparse matrix.
Performance Evaluation: Compares memory usage and access times between dense and sparse representations.
Technologies Used:
Java
XML for configuration and data storage
Example Usage:
java
Copy code
SparseMatrix sparseMatrix = new SparseMatrix();
sparseMatrix.add(0, 1, 5); // Adds value 5 at position (0, 1)
3. Restaurant Application
Description:
This project simulates a restaurant management system. It allows managing menus, orders, and customer data using various data structures to optimize performance and usability.

Key Features:
Menu Management: Add, update, and remove menu items efficiently.
Order Processing: Uses queues to handle customer orders, ensuring first-come-first-served service.
Customer Database: Implements data structures to store customer information, enabling easy retrieval and modification.
Reporting: Generates reports on sales, popular menu items, and customer interactions.
Technologies Used:
Java
XML for menu data management
Example Usage:
java
Copy code
Restaurant restaurant = new Restaurant();
restaurant.addMenuItem("Pasta", 12.99);
restaurant.takeOrder("John Doe", "Pasta");
4. Hotel System Using Data Structures
Description:
This project implements a hotel reservation system that manages room bookings, customer data, and availability using appropriate data structures. It aims to demonstrate efficient handling of hotel operations.

Key Features:
Room Management: Manages room availability using sparse tables or linked lists to represent occupied and available rooms.
Booking System: Allows users to book, cancel, and view reservations with proper error handling for overlapping dates.
User Interface: Provides a simple command-line or GUI for user interactions.
Data Storage: Uses XML to persist room and booking information, facilitating easy data retrieval and updates.
Technologies Used:
Java
XML for configuration and data storage
Example Usage:
java
Copy code
Hotel hotel = new Hotel();
hotel.bookRoom("101", "John Smith", "2024-10-01", "2024-10-05");
Conclusion
These projects highlight the practical application of data structures in various domains. By implementing algorithms and systems, they enhance the understanding of how data can be efficiently managed and manipulated in real-world scenarios.
